## Preword

Hello, it's been a while since the last update of this presence, and I finally did it. 

This update introduces 10 supported domains outside www.deviantart.com, which I don't know if a lot of people use it, except sta.sh. I think there are more than 6k lines added within this update, along with refactors here and there.

This updates have been done since weeks ago, but I finally pushed it because of the changes requested. So, here you go.

## Changelog

- Changed things for consistency
- Supported more domains
	- about.deviantart.com
	- chat.deviantart.com
	- forum.deviantart.com
	- groups.deviantart.com
	- portfolio.deviantart.com
	- shop.deviantart.com
	- www.deviantartsupport.com
	- eclipsefeedback.com
	- deviantartads.com
	- sta.sh
- Supported more pages on www.deviantart.com
- Added multiple code functions
- Changed default presence texts (request from staff members)

## Notes

- In my side, sometimes the presence didn't work and requires reloading. I think this happened because I used Edge and my laptop is kind of acting weird. It should work 100% in theory.
- I removed the ``null``s into ``undefined``. Hope you guys like it.
- I'm going to request this one first, and then do the other requests, in case you need more changes.
